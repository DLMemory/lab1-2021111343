We construct a three-country model to determine how the formation of free trade areas (FTAs) affects optimal tariffs and welfare. 
We find that,at constant rest of the world (ROW) tariffs,the adoption of internal free trade induces union members 
to reduce their external tariffs below the Kemp–Wan@[J. Int. Econom. 6 (1976) 95–97 ] level,~
and causes ROW’s terms of trade to improve and its welfare to rise.
